# Multi-Map Navigation in ROS Noetic

This ROS Noetic package implements **multi-map navigation** using a wormhole mechanism to transition between separate maps. It is ideal for applications such as indoor mobile robots operating in large environments divided into multiple rooms or floors.

## Features

- üó∫Ô∏è Support for multiple maps
- üï≥Ô∏è Wormhole-based transition between maps
- üß† SQLite3 database for storing wormhole positions
- ü§ñ ROS action server (`multi_map_navigation_server`) for managing navigation goals across maps
- ‚úÖ Compatible with `move_base`, `amcl`, and standard ROS navigation stack

## Architecture

- Each room or environment is mapped separately using `gmapping` or `cartographer`.
- Wormholes are overlapping regions between maps that serve as transition points.
- The system queries a local SQLite3 database to determine when and where to switch maps.
- A C++ ROS node manages switching maps and relaying navigation goals accordingly.

## Dependencies

- ROS Noetic
- `sqlite3` (for database interaction)
- `tf2`, `move_base`, `amcl`, `map_server`, `nav_msgs`, `geometry_msgs`
- OpenCV (if using image-based map parsing)
- `actionlib` (for the navigation server)

## Installation

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/MoTawfik11/multi_map.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

## How to Run

To launch the multi-map navigation system, follow these steps:

1. **Launch your mobile robot in Gazebo.**  
   Ensure your robot is properly spawned and publishing necessary topics (e.g., `/odom`, `/tf`, `/scan`).

2. **Create and save multiple maps.**  
   Use SLAM tools (e.g., `gmapping` or `cartographer`) to create at least two maps. Save them in the `maps/` directory inside this repository.

3. **Launch the multi-map navigation system.**  
   In one terminal:

   ```bash
   cd ~/catkin_ws
   catkin_make
   source devel/setup.bash
   roslaunch multi_map_nav multi_map_nav.launch
   ```

4. Run the action client to send navigation goals.
   In a separate terminal:

  ```bash
   cd ~/catkin_ws
  source devel/setup.bash
  rosrun multi_map_nav action.py
```

‚úÖ Make sure the multi_map_nav package and all dependencies are correctly sourced and built before running.
